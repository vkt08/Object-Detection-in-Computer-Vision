# Description

The .ipynb file is the Colab Notebook with all the necessary code.

best_model.pth is the best model achieved by training the model.

------------------------------------
*!NOTE:- But this model is not the model trained on the same configuration as given in the code. It was trained on other configuration.*

*For your reference to compare both the models, this model and the model achieved by training on the configuration of the Notebook.*

*Also, one more thing, all the results that we've calculated is on this model only, not on the Notebook's Model.*

*Because this model worked best for us. But this is not generalised.*

*The General which will work good on any problem at hand is this which is provided by the Notebook. That's why, written there.*

------------------------------------

mAP_value_RCNN stores the *mAP@0.5* value.

precision_recall_results_RCNN stores the results of *Precision & Recall* for each class in a dictionary.

saved_variable_act stores the dictionary named as act_box_all_images in the Notebook.

saved_variable_pred stores the dictionary named as pred_box_all_images in the Notebook.
